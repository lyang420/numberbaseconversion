# Number Base Converter

Basic exercise with ArrayLists, loops, and conversion of integers between bases in Java.

## Timeline

January 3, 2022: Uploaded.

June 15, 2022: Edited repository name, updated suggestions for improvement.

July 9, 2022: Rearranged files in folders in repository. Implemented loop to support continuous conversion of inputs without having to restart program every time.

## Suggestions for Improvement

Implement functionality for larger numbers in different bases. Currently, input only accepts integers, so maximum possible input is Integer.MAX_VALUE. Program would be unable to read a binary number like 1010111010000101010101111.

Implement functionality for hexadecimal numbers. Currently, input only accepts integers, so program would not work for an input like "AF5."

Implement functionality for users to convert numbers into any base they want, as opposed to just decimal.
