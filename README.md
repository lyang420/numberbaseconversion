## Suggestions for Improvement

Implement functionality for larger numbers in different bases. Currently, input only accepts integers, so maximum possible input is Integer.MAX_VALUE. Program would be unable to read a binary number like 1010111010000101010101111.

Implement functionality for hexadecimal numbers. Currently, input only accepts integers, so program would not work for an input like "AF5."

Implement loop to support continuous conversion of inputs without having to run program every time.
